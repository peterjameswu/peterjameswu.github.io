			<p>London-born to a Malaysian mum and a Mauritian dad, I speak Mandarin Chinese and French, which both hover around advanced levels of fluency. I've had stints living in Beijing, Singapore, Taiwan, and France, with most of my travel plans centering around these regions. But I did go as far North as I dared when I studied Chinese with French at the University of Durham.

			<p> My interests tend to swing between the gastronomic delights of Oriental cuisine, the flowing and fast-paced martial arts of badminton, funky European dance music (the likes of Breakbot, Parov Stelar, Bonobo), and I never tire of the many stories told through world cinema. I like full-bodied complex wine, playful Indian Pale Ales, and a Neil Asterley anthology of contemporary poetry is never too far from me. When it's time to travel, I prefer remote quiet spots with a sunset view and losing myself down random streets, eager to discover hidden areas with every turn.</p>
